# DMProject
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide according to WHO. Therefore,
being able to detect abnormalities in heartbeats is an important task. The motivation behind this project is
to be able to automatically classify and distinguish normal heartbeats from abnormal ones.

The proposed solution is a Machine Learning Model that can classify real heart audio (also known
as “beat classification”) into one of multiple categories: Normal, Extrahls, Extrastole, Murmur, Artifact.
Heartbeats consist of 2 consecutive noises called ‘lub’ and ‘dub’ which are produced due to the heart
movements. These noises are of varying frequencies and occur in close proximity in normal situations. In
my project, I aim to use different techniques to classify these heartbeats into the aforementioned classes.
